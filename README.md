## what you'll find here

this is where i dump code that works (sometimes). each repository is either a stroke of genius or a beautiful disaster - honestly, even i'm not sure which is which half the time.

## repository categories

**🚀 stuff that actually works**  
projects i can show without feeling embarrassed

**🧪 random experiments**  
"what happens if i..." type of repositories

**📚 learning stuff**  
following tutorials and seeing how badly i can mess them up

**🤷‍♂️ questionable decisions**  
we all have these. at least mine compile.
## what to expect

most stuff here actually runs. some of it even does what it's supposed to do. browse around and see what happens - worst case scenario, you learn what not to do.

## random repo facts

- commit messages range from professional to "fix stuff"
- some repos started as 5-minute fixes and became week-long projects
- my code comments are either way too detailed or completely missing

## explore at your own risk

each repository is an adventure. some will teach you something new, others will teach you what not to do. both are valuable learning experiences!

*feel free to look around. if something breaks, it's probably not your fault.* 🤷‍♂️
