# Hello there👋

> *"It works on my machine"*

## What you'll find here

This is where I dump code that works (sometimes). Each repository is either a stroke of genius or a beautiful disaster - honestly, even I'm not sure which is which half the time.

## Repository categories

**🚀 Stuff that actually works**  
Projects I can show without feeling embarrassed

**🧪 Random experiments**  
"What happens if I..." type of repositories

**📚 Learning stuff**  
Following tutorials and seeing how badly I can mess them up

**🤷‍♂️ Questionable decisions**  
We all have these. At least mine compile.

## What to expect

Most stuff here actually runs. Some of it even does what it's supposed to do. Browse around and see what happens - worst case scenario, you learn what not to do.

## Random repo facts

- Commit messages range from professional to "fix stuff"
- Some repos started as 5-minute fixes and became week-long projects
- My code comments are either way too detailed or completely missing
- Half my READMEs just say "# Project Name"

## Explore at your own risk

Each repository is an adventure. Some will teach you something new, others will teach you what not to do. Both are valuable learning experiences!

*Feel free to look around. If something breaks, it's probably not your fault.* 🤷‍♂️
