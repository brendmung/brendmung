## What you'll find here

This is where I dump code that works (sometimes). Each repository is either a stroke of genius or a beautiful disaster - honestly, even I'm not sure which is which half the time. Browse at your own risk!

## Repository categories

**🚀 Stuff that actually works**  
Projects I can show without crying

**🧪 Random experiments**  
"What happens if I..." type of repositories (spoiler: usually chaos)

**📚 Learning stuff**  
Following tutorials and speedrunning how to break them

**🤷‍♂️ Questionable decisions**  
We all have these. Mine just happen to be public and judging me daily.

## Repository warning labels

- 🟢 **Green commits:** Everything works, tests pass, I'm basically a genius
- 🟡 **Yellow commits:** Works on my machine, probably fine elsewhere (probably)  
- 🔴 **Red commits:** "Future me will figure this out" - past me was wrong
- ⚫ **Black commits:** If you see these, just pretend you didn't

## Random repo facts

- Commit messages range from professional to "fix stuff" to complete gibberish
- Some repos started as 5-minute fixes and became existential crises
- My code comments are either dissertations or just "// magic happens here"
- Half my READMEs just say "# Project Name" and call it a day

## Explore at your own risk

Each repository is an adventure. Some will make you think "wow, clever!" Others will make you question my life choices. Both reactions are completely valid.

*Browse around, star what doesn't make you lose faith in humanity, and remember - we've all written code we're not proud of. Mine's just documented in git history forever.* 🫠
